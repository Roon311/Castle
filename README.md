# Castle
Data structure project

This project is mainly about creating a code of a game using C++
and to use the main priciples and concepts of data stuctures 
and how to use (Stacks, Queues, Priority_Queues....)
the castle fight with the enemies(Fighters, Freezers, Healers)
Fighters can only fight with the castle
Freezers only are trying to freeze the castle
Healters are trying to heal the fighters and freezers
All enemies do its own missions in certain techniques
Each enemy type can do certain identified tasks

In specific moments, the castle could use its own supersoldiers
we could run the program in silent, interactive, step by step, or demo modes


we can choose the file of the data of the whole enemies

Red rectangulars -> Fighters
Yellow rectangulars -> Healers
Blue rectangulars -> Freezers
Green Rectangulars -> Super Soldiers (from the castle)
The castle -> the middle of the screen

the distance of the enemy from the castle and health are driven from certain equations

Finally, there are a printed file of the whole battle, For example, Castle win or lose, which enemy die first,
some statistics about the enemies
