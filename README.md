# Castle
Data structure project

This project is mainly about creating a code of a game using C++
and to use the main priciples and concepts of data stuctures 
and how to use (Stacks, Queues, Priority_Queues....)
the castle fight with the enemies(Fighters, Freezers, Healers)
Fighters can only fight with the castle
Freezers only are trying to freeze the castle
Healters are trying to heal the fighters and freezers
All enemies do its own missions in certain techniques
In specific moments, the castle could use its own supersoldiers
we could run the program in silent, interactive, step by step, or demo modes
